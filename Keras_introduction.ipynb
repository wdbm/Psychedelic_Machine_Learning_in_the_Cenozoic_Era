    "Keras is a more high-level neural network library than TensorFlow and can use TensorFlow as a backend, and is supported by the TensorFlow developers. Keras features implementations of neural network layers (including dropout, batch normalization and pooling), objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and features support for convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Keras is perhaps one of the better options for rapid prototyping of deep learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in Keras are of two forms, Sequential and Functional API. The Sequential approach enables stacking of sequential and recurrent layers ordering from input to output while the Functional API approach enables more complicated arcitectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras features callbacks utilities which can be used to track variables during training. These can be used to create checkpoints at which models are saved while training in case of crashes and whatnot. A callback class, which is a class that inherits from `keras.callbacks.Callback`, is passed to the model fitting function and could be used to log something like the accuracy as training is progressing. More specifically, `keras.callbacks.Callback` has methods that can be overridden in a callback class definition; methods such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `on_train_begin`\n",
    "- `on_epoch_end`\n",
    "- `on_batch_begin`\n",
    "- `on_batch_end`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are moments in training at which things can be done. Useful in overriding these methods is the `logs` dictionary which, by default, holds loss and accuracy during training."
